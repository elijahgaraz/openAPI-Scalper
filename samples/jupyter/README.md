# Jupyter Sample

This is sample that will show you how to use the OpenApiPy Python package on a Jupyter notebook.

In the notebook we get the daily bars data from cTrader Open API, then we use it to train a sklearn model.

To use the sample you have to create a copy of "credentials.json" file and rename it to "credentials-dev.json".

Then fill the file with your Open API application credentials, access token, and a trading account ID.
