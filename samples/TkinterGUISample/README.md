# Tkinter GUI Sample

This sample demonstrates a minimal Tkinter GUI that connects to the OpenApiPy `Client`.

The application shows two tabs:

* **Trading** - Start/stop a sample scalping loop, view trade history and account metrics.
* **Settings** - Enter API credentials used for authentication.

Run the example with `python main.py`.
